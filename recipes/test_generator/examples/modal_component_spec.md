# Modal Component Specification

## Purpose

The Modal component is a reusable UI element that displays content in a layer over the main page, requiring user interaction before returning to the main content. It provides a consistent way to present dialogs, forms, and other temporary content throughout the application.

## Core Requirements

- Display content in a visually distinct layer above the page
- Support opening and closing via props
- Include a close button (X) in the top-right corner
- Render an optional title in the header
- Support closing on ESC key press
- Support closing on backdrop click (optional, configurable)
- Block scroll on the main page when open
- Support focus trapping within the modal for accessibility
- Animate smoothly when opening and closing
- Support custom sizes (small, medium, large, full)
- Provide render hooks for header, footer, and body content

## Props

| Prop Name | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| isOpen | boolean | false | Controls whether the modal is visible |
| onClose | function | required | Callback when modal requests to close |
| title | string or ReactNode | - | Optional title to display in the header |
| size | 'sm', 'md', 'lg', 'full' | 'md' | Controls the size of the modal |
| closeOnBackdropClick | boolean | true | Whether clicking backdrop closes modal |
| closeOnEsc | boolean | true | Whether pressing ESC closes modal |
| hideCloseButton | boolean | false | Option to hide the close button |
| children | ReactNode | required | Content to render in the modal body |
| headerContent | ReactNode | - | Custom content for header (replaces default) |
| footerContent | ReactNode | - | Content to render in the footer |
| className | string | - | Additional CSS class for styling |

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```jsx
<Modal
  isOpen={isModalOpen}
  onClose={() => setIsModalOpen(false)}
  title="Information"
>
  <p>This is a basic modal with some content.</p>
</Modal>
```

### With Footer Content

```jsx
<Modal
  isOpen={isConfirmOpen}
  onClose={() => setIsConfirmOpen(false)}
  title="Confirm Action"
  footerContent={
    <div className="button-group">
      <Button variant="secondary" onClick={() => setIsConfirmOpen(false)}>Cancel</Button>
      <Button variant="primary" onClick={handleConfirm}>Confirm</Button>
    </div>
  }
>
  <p>Are you sure you want to proceed with this action?</p>
</Modal>
```

### Full Screen Modal

```jsx
<Modal
  isOpen={isDetailsOpen}
  onClose={() => setIsDetailsOpen(false)}
  title="Detailed View"
  size="full"
>
  <DetailedContent item={selectedItem} />
</Modal>
```

## Component Behavior

1. When `isOpen` changes to true, the modal should appear with an animation
2. Focus should automatically move to the first focusable element in the modal
3. Tab key should cycle through focusable elements without leaving the modal
4. Clicking the close button or backdrop (if enabled) should trigger the `onClose` callback
5. Pressing ESC (if enabled) should trigger the `onClose` callback
6. When closed, focus should return to the element that had focus before the modal opened
7. The main page should be non-scrollable while the modal is open

## Accessibility Requirements

- Modal container should have role="dialog"
- Modal should have aria-modal="true"
- Modal should have aria-labelledby pointing to the title ID
- Close button should have aria-label="Close"
- Focus trap should be implemented for keyboard navigation
- Modal should announce its opening to screen readers
- Color contrast should meet WCAG AA standards

## Design and Styling

- The modal should be centered in the viewport
- Backdrop should be dark with some transparency
- Modal should have appropriate padding and border radius
- Header should have visual separation from body
- Footer should have visual separation from body
- Close button should be easily visible and clickable
- The modal should be responsive on all device sizes

## Error Handling

- If no onClose is provided, log a warning
- Handle unexpected children gracefully
- Prevent focus trap errors if no focusable elements exist
- Handle multiple modals appropriately (stacking)

## Performance Considerations

- Modal content should be lazy-loaded when possible
- Use CSS transitions for animations to leverage GPU
- Consider using React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Properly clean up event listeners on unmount

## Implementation Notes

- The component should use React's Portal to render outside the DOM hierarchy
- Use React's useEffect for handling keyboard events and focus management
- Consider using a custom hook for focus trapping functionality
- Use CSS modules or styled-components for styling
